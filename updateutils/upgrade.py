"""
This module contains the functionality required to upgrade to the next major
version of Amber/AmberTools. Since I don't know what form that upgrade will
take, I will enforce a very flexible one now that will be a little kludgey.

Here is how it will work:

An "upgrade" folder will be present on the Amber web with three files:

   message.txt
   upgrade.patch.bz2
   upgrade
 
message.txt -- a text file with the message that will be displayed to the user
     after applying the upgrade. It should also contain the last patch that
     should be applied before updater.patch is applied for both AmberTools and
     Amber. It will then apply up to that patch -or- reverse back to that patch
     for both Amber and AmberTools (or only one if the other is not listed).
     This file should have the format:

BEGIN DESCRIPTION
put a small description here. Keep it short and 1-liner
END DESCRIPTION
BEGIN MESSAGE
put your message here, as you want it formatted
END MESSAGE
AmberTools patch level = #
Amber patch level = #

upgrade.patch -- a patch applied to anything necessary that is required to bring
     it up-to-date with the newest version. (Can be gzipped or bzipped)

upgrade -- a script of any kind that will be downloaded to AMBERHOME, given
     execute permissions, and then run to complete the update. If it is
     ultimately unnecessary, it can simply be a no-op. The script will be tested
     for successful or unsuccessful application, so please make sure that it
     returns an appropriate error code. The upgrade file will be removed after
     it is run. It is run from AMBERHOME.
