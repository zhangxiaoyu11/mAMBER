We propose a parallel acceleration strategy for MD simulation software: Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement (AMBER) on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer. The parallel optimization of AMBER is carried out on three different levels. By the fine grained OpenMP parallel on a single CPU, single node CPU-MIC parallel optimization, and multi-node multi-MIC collaborated parallel acceleration, the highest speedup of 5-6 times is achieved compared with the original program.
