This directory contains the "amberlite" set of tools from Romain M. Wolf.
These build on AmberTools itself, and provide a relatively simple path
for users to carry out certain protein and ligand manipulations that are
useful in drug discovery and other applications.

Documentation is in the file doc/amberlite.pdf.
