			Xraw Widget Set 
	   remake the well-known Athena widget set


Acknowledgements


Xraw is mainly derived from Xaw (author Chris D. Reterson) 
and partly Xaw3d (author Kaleb Keithley). This is an attempt to remake
Xaw by addding 3d rendering in widget imaging as is in OSF/Motif. 
In addition some new widgets were created. All work is being 
performed on the X11 R4.

It began as part of work on the LEaP molecular graphics program in 
the AMBER Project at Peter Kollman's lab at the University of California, 
San Francisco. 

Bill Ross commissioned the work and provided helpful suggestions. 
It really could not have been done without him - thanks, Bill! 

Xraw is good to compile under R4 and R5.  It compiles cleanly on 
a SunOS 4.1.3, Ultrix 4.3, HPUX A.09.05, IRIX 5.2, OSF/1.

New widgets was added to Xaw:
	Arrow
	Conteiner
	Frame
	Table
	ScrolledTable
	Separator
