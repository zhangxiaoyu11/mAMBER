This test uses a 5ps md simulation of NMA in vacuum where the the coordinates
are recorded every 250fs. Thus the mdcrd file contains 20 structures.

The job should run and create 5 gaussian input files using the settings shown
in the Job Control file.

Check that the files written match the saved files.
