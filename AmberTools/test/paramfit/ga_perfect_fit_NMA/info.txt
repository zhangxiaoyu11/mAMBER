This fit is a perfect fit for NMA. The force field used is the
parm99.dat force field. The fit is to 100 structures in the interests
of speed.

The energy file has been generated by taking the amber energy for
each step and as such the simplex routine should be able to fit
this data perfectly.

Note: I had to modify sander slightly to get it to write me more
decimal places for the energies and mdcrd file. Otherwise you get
rounding errors that propogate. Also note that the MDCRD file is
actually slightly out of step with the output file. So structure
1 of the mdcrd file is actually step 2 of the output file. And
structure 2000 of mdcrd is 2001 of output file.

In extracting the amber energies I have corrected for this.

K = 0.0  - adjustment to the bond+angle data has been made.

So, energy file: adjusted_bond+angle.dat = bond energy + angle energy
+dihedral energy + 1-4VDW + 1-4EEL + VDW + EEL - K
 
Fit for bond+angle+dihedral amber standard

A selection of angles and dihedrals describing the backbone has
been selected to be fit.
 
See how the program reads in the parameters and fits the data.

Since I used the amber energies the data should be fit perfectly.

Final R2 for fit should be 1.00000

Final parameters should be (There will be minor differences due to rounding
errors):
