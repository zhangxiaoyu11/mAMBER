#sample residuegen input file
#INPUT_FILE: 	   	Structure file in ac format, generated from a Gaussian output with 'antechamber'
#               	(Cmd: antechamber -fi gout -fo ac -i input.gout -o output.ac)
INPUT_FILE      	ala.ac

#CONF_NUM:      	Number of conformations applied
CONF_NUM        	2

#ESP_FILE:      	ESP file generated from gaussian output with 'espgen'
#               	(cmd: espgen -i input.gout -o output.esp)
#               	if multiple conformations applied, catenate all the CONF_NUM esp files into ESP_FILE
#               	(cmd: cat output1.esp output2.esp output3.esp ... > output.esp)
ESP_FILE        	ala.esp

#SEP_BOND:      	Bonds that separate residue and caps, input in a format of (Atom_Name1 Atom_Name2 TYPE),
#              	 	where Atom_Name1 belongs to the residue and Atom_Name2 belongs to the cap. When TYPE is
#			1, ATOM_NAME1, the HEAD_ATOM, is connected to the immediate proceeding residue, such as 
#			N of an amino acid; when TYPE is -1, ATOM_NAME1, the TAIL_ATOM, is connected to the 
#			immediate succeeding residue, such as C of an amino acid; when TYPE is 0, it is just 
#			used to trunctat unwanted atoms (such as extra side chain atoms). SEP_BOND may show up 
#			several times or not show up at all.
SEP_BOND        	N1 C2	1
SEP_BOND        	C5 N2	-1

#PSEUDO_HEAD_ATOM:     	Psedu_head_atom is used to model N-terminal amino acid residues, such as NALA or 5'
#			-nucleic acid residue, such as DC5. Input in a format of (Atom_Name), may show up only 
#			once (amino-acid-like and nucleic-acid-like terminal residues) or not show up at all 
#			for organic molecules. This option is suppressed by a SEP_BOND with TYPE of 1.
PSEUDO_HEAD_ATOM       	N1

#PSEUDO_TAIL_ATOM:     	Psedu_tail_atom is used to model C-terminal amino acid residues, such as CALA or 3'
#			-nucleic acid residue, such as DC3. Input in a format (Atom_Name), may show up only 
#			once (amino-acid-like and nucleic-acid-like terminal residues) or not show up at all
#			for organic molecules. This option is suppressed by a SEP_BOND with TYPE of -1.
PSEUDO_TAIL_ATOM       	C5

#			Main chain atoms are those starting from HEAD_ATOM or PSEUDO_HEAD_ATOM and ending at 
#			TAIL_ATOM or PSEUDO_TAIL_ATOM for the amino-acid-like or nucleic-acid-like residues.
#			For organic molecules, main chain atoms are those forming the longest chain. Main 
#			chain atoms are identified automatically (not need to specify). 

#NET_CHARGE:    	Net charge of the residue, such as 0 of ALA and -1 of ASP and 1 of LYS
#               	this option is ignored when the number of SEP_BOND lines is zero
NET_CHARGE      	0

#ATOM_CHARGE:   	Predefined atom charge, input in a format of (Atom_Name Partial_Charge)
#               	can show up multiple times.
ATOM_CHARGE     	N1 -0.4175
